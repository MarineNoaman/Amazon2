Hereâ€™s a sample `README.md` file for your project. It includes information about the project, its setup, usage, and a brief description of how to execute the tests.

# Amazon20 Automation Project

This project is an automation test suite for Amazon-like shopping platform, built using Selenium, TestNG, Cucumber, and ExtentReports.

## Technologies Used

- **Selenium**: For browser automation.
- **TestNG**: For running tests and generating reports.
- **Cucumber**: For Behavior-Driven Development (BDD).
- **ExtentReports**: For generating detailed test execution reports.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- Java 23 or higher
- Maven
- An IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
- WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/amazon20.git
   cd amazon20
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn install
   ```

3. **Set up WebDriver**:
    - Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) and set its path in your system environment variable or specify it in the code.

## Test Execution

To execute the tests, run the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn test
```

The tests will run and generate an Extent report with detailed information about the execution.

## Feature File Example

A feature file example (`add_to_cart.feature`) is included in this project:

```gherkin
Feature: User can choose and add to cart

  @smo
  Scenario: Valid add to cart
    Given Home page appears and user clicks on Signup/login
    When User enters Email address and password

    When User clicks on a product to view
    Then User clicks on "Add to Cart"
    Given User clicks on cart
    When User clicks on proceed to checkout
    And User clicks on place order
    Then User enters payment data1
    And User enters payment data2
    And User enters payment data3
    And User enters payment data4
    And User enters payment data5
    And User enters payment data6
```

## Maven `pom.xml` Configuration

The `pom.xml` contains all necessary dependencies for the project. It includes dependencies for Selenium, TestNG, Cucumber, and ExtentReports.
